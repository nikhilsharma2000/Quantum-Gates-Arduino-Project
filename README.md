# Quantum-Gates-Arduino-Project
Built an Arduino based interactive system for learning about Quantum Gates from Scratch.

This project deals with the functioning of Quantum Gates. We have built a small system
that essentially encompasses three qubits as input, allowing us to apply a user-selected
gate, which then gives a processed output with its corresponding phase. This provides a
very hands-on experience of how certain Quantum Gates function when classical inputs
are applied, showing us a visible shift in either the bit and/or the phase. This project has
been incredibly engaging and motivating, as we develop a one-of-a-kind tool—or a "toy,"
in loose terms—that lets us experiment with inputs and learn about various Quantum
Gates in a fun and interactive manner.
In building this project, we combined multiple skills to create an ensemble of electronics
powered by a C program, alongside basic knowledge of Quantum Gates and Qubits.
This experience allowed us to integrate both practical electronics and theoretical
quantum concepts into a cohesive system. The theoretical background to these topics,
along with the detailed circuit schematic, is provided in the following sections of the
report. Additionally, we have outlined methods to further enhance the system, aiming to
make it even more enjoyable and interactive for students and researchers alike.

Overall, we are very excited to have done a project in under 2 months, after having
learned and worked on various skills, including Programming in C, Arduino, Electronics,
and some basics of the theoretical background in Quantum Gates. It was an exciting
journey of learning, reading, searching, troubleshooting, as well as working in unison to
bring together a great project that we can all be proud of.
In conclusion, we are able to show what we want to achieve and display something that
is not available on the internet at all. We have shown a good procedure to enhance the
learning in students for quantum gates and make it interactive for students of quantum
technology and physics as well as mathematics. The entire project has left us with a lot
of learning as well as taught us how to deal with real-time problems as well as build
something that we promised. What is promised must be delivered, and we stood the
test of time, thus displaying resilience and the importance of discipline among
ourselves.
For a foreword note, we believe many such extensive devices can be made that
enhance students’ learning and better help them learn concepts in quantum computing,
in a very fun and interactive manner, without having to worry about diving into the theory
all of a sudden. This can help build that foundational introduction in children of younger
age in schools and incline them towards this field. This can, as we called it in the
introduction, become a toy that very delicately displays a crucial and intricate concept
with ease for everyone to learn and help incline children towards research and
development in this field, for humanity’s greater good

This project can also be further enhanced by utilizing a few techniques to make it more
interactive and pleasing to the eyes while making the learning effective. We can also
write an extensive MATLAB code that entails the entire state vector on a Bloch
Sphere(a spherical representation of a vector in 3-D space). When each gate is
pressed, it rotates the vector along the sphere using the corresponding gate. We can
also improve and make the system more precise and natural by mitigating the
superposition between various qubits and utilizing other gates to give a superposition

output that fluctuates as we observe, which can be called a miniature quantum
computer in loose terms.
